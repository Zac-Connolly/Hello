# Hello
My first github repository

Hi fellow Humans!

Zac here, I AM passionate about learning (and teaching) and wish to utilise the github community to empower anywhere, anytime learning.
We are living in the best of times and the worst of times.
How Humanity gets through these tumultuous times, will determine who we truly are as a species.

I wish to find entrepid adventurers who want to use their skills to make this life; that we're co-creating; fun and exciting!
