# Hello
My first github repository

Hi fellow Humans!

Zac here, I AM passionate about learning (and teaching) and wish to utilise the github community to empower anywhere, anytime learning.
We are living in the best of times and the worst of times, and how Humanity gets through this will determine who we truly are.
